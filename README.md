Simple Login Page – Project Description

The Simple Login Page is a beginner-friendly web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates how basic client-side authentication works by validating user credentials entered in a login form.

The application provides a clean and responsive user interface with input fields for username and password. When the user enters the correct credentials, a success message is displayed and the user is redirected to another page. If the credentials are incorrect, an error message is shown instantly without reloading the page.

This project is designed for learning purposes and helps in understanding form handling, DOM manipulation, conditional logic, and basic user interaction in JavaScript. It serves as a foundational example for beginners who want to learn web development and client-side validation.
